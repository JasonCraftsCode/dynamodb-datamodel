# Working and Tested examples

It is extremely frustrating copying example code that does not work or requires some unknown setup to work. The intend of this folder is to have examples that can be embed into documentation (typedoc supports [[include:Fields.compositeNamed.ts]] based embedding) and also make it easy for user to copy and paste fully working examples.

This also allows the examples to be linted, prettied, built and tested.

All of the examples will be in typescript, but some will also be in javascript focusing on the examples that use generics and key or model interfaces.
